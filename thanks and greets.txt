Huge thanks and big ups to Mike D who is my long-time collaborator on many 3D printed projects.  His ability to rapidly digest my ideas and turn them into something feasible and printable is nothing short of legendary and I couldn't focus on as many projects as I do without his remarkable efforts.

Tony from 3D Locksport as well as Babak and James over at CORE with me are all doing terrific printing work, as well, and we love sharing our projects with you all whenever possible.  Thanks to everyone who offers feedback and enjoys this!
